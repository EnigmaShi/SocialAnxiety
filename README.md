Me and my other colleagues of GDSC MUST ML-AI Team were asked to make a Wordcloud of our favourite wikipedia page. So I chose Blockchain and installed the essential libraries wordcloud, requests and wikipediaapi. I was recommended to use user-agent but the process turned out to be lengthy so I installed requests Library.
